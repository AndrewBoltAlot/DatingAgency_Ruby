All works correctly

Unit tests need more work

Detailed Statement:

Added the Aga and Zin subclasses of the Single super class
Introduced logic for the specific subclasses in regards to match? method.
In zin class, cloned instance of Aga when they on a date, so change to desirability is not permanent.

In Single intizialized a variable called fussiness that is based on the method fussiness.
Method fussiness is @sought_desirability - @desirability
gave desirability and attr_accessor, so that it could be changed within the Zin class.

This is then called upon in the dating agency class, with the method organize_by_fussiness
organize_by_fussiness method is used to sort the single list according to fussiness then name
This method is then called before the while loop in the match method within the Dating Agency class.

In the main.rb an if, while loop is created to find out how many hobbies a Single has and to store them within an array of hobbies.
Furthermore, instead of creating an instance of a single class for each person, an instance of either an Aga or Zin class is created
based on if their gender is either 'a' or 'z'.
